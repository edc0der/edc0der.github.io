The site is LIVE! I'll be updating the site style, content and post blog entries as often as posible, in order to provide a full spectrum of what I do and how I do it. 

### Missing

I'm still missing the "portfolio" section. It's coming along.

I'm currently building a demo app called [BreedPic](https://github.com/edc0der/BreedPic) on my spare time out of work. As soon as I have a prototype, I'll include screenshot and snippets of code. 

### Thanks to

I'd like to thank [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark), whose repo I forked following the steps on his awesome tutorial, found here: [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages
](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
