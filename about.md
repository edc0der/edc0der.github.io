I'm a developer with over 7 years of working experience in multiple areas, though in the las 2+ years I've been focusing on iOS native development in Objective-C, Swift and mixed codebase. Building native layouts which match the designs and/or providing suggestions to make the UI/UX enjoyable to the iOS user, coding new features, as well as finding and fixing bugs. I do my best to deliver quality work on a timely manner.
